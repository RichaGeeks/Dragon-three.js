<h3>🐉 3D Dragon Animation with Three.js </h3>
Welcome to my interactive 3D Dragon website! Built using Three.js, GLTFLoader, GSAP, and OrbitControls, this project features a fully animated 3D dragon model that responds dynamically to scroll events. Whether you're here for the fire-breathing aesthetics or the code wizardry—this one's for you.

🧠 Learnings & Intent 
<br>
“Why a dragon?” Because dragons are the perfect blend of mythical storytelling and technical 3D challenge. I wanted to push the boundary of what’s possible with lightweight Three.js projects and make it scroll-aware. Each section gives the dragon a new pose or vibe. This was built as a fun and fierce frontend experiment!
